            Hi, my name is Chris Harden and I will be giving you a little look into my life.I am 31 years old and married with my first child. My son's name is Roland
            and he was born in April. My main hobbies are working on my home, training with guns, and working on my motorcycle. I am a Marine veteran and served from 2009 - 2014. 
            I was born and raised in Texas.
